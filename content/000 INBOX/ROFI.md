###### PRIMARY CATEGORY â†’ [[SETUP]]

**[Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) â†’ Application Launcher**

Basically, It's an application launcher and a ssh-launcher

Displays to the user a list of options from which one or more options can be selected

In this case, It is a list of the applications that are installed on the system

`rofi` is launched by the [[SXHKD|sxhkd]] daemon when a certain input event, such as a _Hotkey_, is performed

```bash title="~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc"
# Rofi Launch
super + d
  /usr/bin/rofi -show run
```

> [!IMPORTANT]-
>
> It is not necessary to modify the above configuration file in this [[SETUP|setup]] environment

#### Installation

> [!CAUTION]-
>
> First, see the [[BSPWM|bspwm's installation]] before proceeding with this one related to `rofi`
>
> There are some dependencies that are needed in the following installation steps
>

```bash
apt install -y -- rofi
```

That's it

```bash
$ command -V rofi
rofi is /usr/bin/rofi
```

> [!IMPORTANT]-
>
> Installation can be done either through the OS package manager or via the `git clone` command
>
> Note that the default OS repositories listed in `/etc/apt/sources.list` file and in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` directory may have older versions unlike the `rofi`'s official Github repository
>
> As It is always is desirable to have the latest versions of any _package_ or _binary_ installed, I'd recommend installing them via their Github Repositories
>
> Although, in this case the _package_'s version installed from the `apt` Package Manager differs only slightly from the github one
