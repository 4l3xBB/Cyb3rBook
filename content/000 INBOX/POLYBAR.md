###### PRIMARY CATEGORY â†’ [[SETUP]]

**`polybar` â†’ Highly Customizable Status Bars**

Each bar has its own modules and It is executed as a daemon

```bash
$ pgrep --list-full --exact polybar
1631 polybar log -c /home/al3xbb/.config/polybar/current.ini
1632 polybar ethernet_bar -c /home/al3xbb/.config/polybar/current.ini
1633 polybar vpn_bar -c /home/al3xbb/.config/polybar/current.ini
```

> [!INFO]-
>
> In above command's output, each process corresponds to a specific bar with its name and its configuration file where the bar and its module/s are declared
>
> ```bash
> polybar log -c /home/al3xbb/.config/polybar/current.ini
>          |                                   |
>          +---> Bar's Name                    +---> Config File
> ```
> - `-c FILE | --config=FILE` â†’ Path to the configuration file

A module can execute any action such as a command, scripts...

> Each bar with its configuration file as an argument is launched by the below script

`polybar` is executed by [[BSPWM|bspwm]] from the [[BSPWM#*bspwmrc*|bspwmrc]] script through the `polybar`'s launcher script â†’ `~/.config/polybar/launch.sh`

```bash
# ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc - Polybar Launch
checkProcess polybar || { launchProcess "$_pbl" ; unset -v -- _pbl ; }
```

> [!INFO]-
>
> Note that `checkProcess` and `launchProcess` are [[SHELL SCRIPTING|shell functions]] declared in the `~/.config/bspwm/src/bspwmrc.sh` [[BSPWM#*src/bspwmrc.sh*|source file]]
>
> The `$_pbl` parameter is also declared in that file being the **Polybar Launcher Path**
>
> Above implementation would be something similar to the usual approach through `pgrep --exact process_name || binary|script_path &` 
>
> ```bash
> #!/usr/bin/env sh
> $ pgrep --exact polybar > /dev/null 2>&1 || ~/.config/polybar/launch.sh &
> ```

**Configuration File â†’ Any file which a `.ini` extension**

##### Polybar Installation

> [!CAUTION]-
>
> First, see the [[BSPWM|bspwm's installation]] before proceeding with this one related to `polybar`
>
> There are some dependencies that are needed in the following installation steps
>

```bash
$ apt install -y -- polybar
```

That's it

```bash
$ command -V polybar
polybar is /usr/bin/polybar
```

> [!IMPORTANT]-
>
> Installation can be done either through the OS package manager or via the `git clone` command
>
> Note that the default OS repositories listed in `/etc/apt/sources.list` file and in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` directory may have older versions unlike the `rofi`'s official Github repository
>
> As It is always is desirable to have the latest versions of any _package_ or _binary_ installed, I'd recommend installing them via their Github Repositories
>
> Although, in this case the _package_'s version installed from the `apt` Package Manager differs only slightly from the github one
