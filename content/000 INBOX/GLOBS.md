| **Globs**  |                 **Meaning**                 |  **e.g**   |
| :--------: | :-----------------------------------------: | :--------: |
|   **\***   |      **Match any str, of any lenght**       |  **foo**   |
| **foo\***  |    **Match any str beginning with foo**     | **footer** |
|  **bar?**  | **Match bar followed by one or cero chars** |  **bart**  |
| **[kz]sh** |     **Match sh beginning with k or z**      |  **ksh**   |

**Globbing, Globs, Filename Expansion** (All the same) happens after [[Word Splitting]], which means that any file expanded through **Globbing** corresponds to One Word for Bash.

```bash
for _file in ./*
do
        rm -f -- "$_file"
done
```

Above code will cause `$_file` parameter to be expanded as `./filename`  instead of `filename` 

>[!CAUTION]
> **Note that this is incorrect üî¥**
> ```bash
> for _file in * # Always use ./* instead of *
> do
>       printf "%s\n" "$_file

> cat * > ../file # Wrong!

> **Previous Example may lead to a command interpreting a file, which name begins with a dash (-), like an option, given the following reasons:**
> - **A file can contain any char in its name except a Null Byte `\0` and Slash `/`**
> - **Rarely a command is not going to interpret a string beginning with a dash like an option (i.e. `command -opt -- arg`)**
>
> **The following Syntax `--`  is often used on a wide variety of commands to indicate end of option processing.**
> 
>**This can be added to previous code as an additional measure to ensure command to not process File as an option due to leading dash**
> ```bash
> for _file in ./*
> do
>       cat -- "$_file"
> done
>
> # As result -> cat -- ./filename
> ```
> >[!IMPORTANT]
> > **Note that `--` syntax should never replace `./` measure, cause not all commands have implemented `--` to indicate end of options, such as `echo` command**

Note that, in previous example, if directory has no files, `*` glob pattern will return the pattern instead `./*`, then `rm` will receive as a non-option argument a non-existent file.

To avoid this issue, check file existence before executing any command which has that file as argument

##### POSIX Compliance

```bash
for _file in ./*
do
        [ -e "$_file" ] || continue # Use [ ] Instead of [[ ]]

        printf "File -> %s\n" "$_file"
done
```

> [!HINT] To Be Considered
> Use `test` or `[ ]` [[Shell Builtins]] instead of `[[ ]]` non-standard Bash

> It's the latest Type of Expasion that happens during **Bash Parsing Process**, aka [[Bash Parser]]

#### Handle Correctly Pathname and Filename

To handle correctly either files with control chars (`"\n", "\t"...`) or another processing-sensitive char, there are different approches to get to the same place ‚û°Ô∏è
