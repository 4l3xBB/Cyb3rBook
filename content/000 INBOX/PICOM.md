###### PRIMARY CATEGORY â†’ [[SETUP]]

**`picom` â†’ Compositor for X**

It manages the way **Windows** and **Graphical Elements** are displayed on the screen

Basically, It combines the above elements, called _**Buffers**_, into a **Final Image** that is displayed to the user

Note that `picom` is a fork of [Compton](https://github.com/yshui/picom/blob/next/History.md), which is already _deprecated_

This binary is executed as a daemon like most of the tools in this [[SETUP|setup]]

```bash
$ pgrep --list-full --exact picom
1930 /usr/local/bin/picom
```

`picom` is executed by [[BSPWM|bspwm]] from the [[BSPWM#*bspwmrc*|bspwmrc]] script through the `picom`'s binary â†’

```bash
# ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc - Picom Launch
checkProcess picom || launchProcess picom
```

> [!INFO]-
>
> Note that `checkProcess` and `launchProcess` are [[SHELL SCRIPTING|shell functions]] declared in the `~/.config/bspwm/src/bspwmrc.sh` [[BSPWM#*src/bspwmrc.sh*|source file]]
>
> Above implementation would be something similar to the usual approach through `pgrep --exact process_name || binary|script_path &` 
>
> ```bash
> #!/usr/bin/env sh
> $ pgrep --exact picom > /dev/null 2>&1 || picom &
> ```

**Configuration File â†’ `~/.config/picom/picom.conf`**
