###### PRIMARY CATEGORY â†’ [[SETUP]]

**`picom` â†’ Compositor for X**

It manages the way **Windows** and **Graphical Elements** are displayed on the screen

Basically, It combines the above elements, called _**Buffers**_, into a **Final Image** that is displayed to the user

Note that `picom` is a fork of [Compton](https://github.com/yshui/picom/blob/next/History.md), which is already _deprecated_

This binary is executed as a daemon like most of the tools in this [[SETUP|setup]]

```bash
$ pgrep --list-full --exact picom
1930 /usr/local/bin/picom
```

`picom` is executed by [[BSPWM|bspwm]] from the [[BSPWM#*bspwmrc*|bspwmrc]] script through the `picom`'s binary â†’

```bash
# ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc - Picom Launch
checkProcess picom || launchProcess picom
```

> [!INFO]-
>
> Note that `checkProcess` and `launchProcess` are [[SHELL SCRIPTING|shell functions]] declared in the `~/.config/bspwm/src/bspwmrc.sh` [[BSPWM#*src/bspwmrc.sh*|source file]]
>
> Above implementation would be something similar to the usual approach through `pgrep --exact process_name || binary|script_path &` 
>
> ```bash
> #!/usr/bin/env sh
> $ pgrep --exact picom > /dev/null 2>&1 || picom &
> ```

**Configuration File â†’ `~/.config/picom/picom.conf`**

**More information [here](https://github.com/yshui/picom)**

##### Installation

> [!CAUTION]-
>
> First, see the [[BSPWM|bspwm's installation]] before proceeding with this one related to `picom`
>
> There are some dependencies that are needed in the following installation steps. That is why  you should see the note above first
>

First of all, install the following dependencies â†’

> Only _Debian Based_ distros. Check [this](https://github.com/yshui/picom#dependencies) for the _Fedora/RHEL_ ones

```bash
$ apt install -y -- libconfig-dev libdbus-1-dev libegl-dev libev-dev libgl-dev libepoxy-dev libpcre2-dev libpixman-1-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-composite0-dev libxcb-damage0-dev libxcb-glx0-dev libxcb-image0-dev libxcb-present-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-render-util0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-util-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev meson ninja-build uthash-dev
```

Clone the [picom's Github Repository](https://github.com/yshui/picom) â†’

```bash
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ git clone https://github.com/yshui/picom.git picom
```

To build â†’

```bash
$ cd !$ # cd ~/Downloads/picom
$ meson setup --buildtype=release build
$ ninja -C build
```

To install â†’

```bash
$ ninja -C build install
```

> [!INFO]-
>
> Note that the default installation dir will be `/usr/local`. To change it, just use â†’
>
> ```bash
> $ meson configure -Dprefix=PATH build
> ```
>

That's it

```bash
$ command -V picom
picom is /usr/local/bin/picom
```

Note that the _picom configuration file_ needs to be created â†’ `picom.conf`

Just created the `~/.config/picom` directory and paste this [[PICOM#Configuration File|Configuration File]]'s content into it

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/picom
$ cd !$ && nvim picom.conf
```

Once the above is done, insert the following line in the [[BSPWM#*bspwmrc*|bspwmrc]] file related to the _Picom's Launch_ â†’

```bash
checkProcess picom || launchProcess picom
```

This allows _picom_ to be launched on the _Windows Manager_ Startup â†’ [[BSPWM|bspwm]]

##### Configuration File

> ***_Picom.conf_ [Configuration File Sample](https://github.com/yshui/picom/blob/next/picom.sample.conf) Fully Documented***

**Copy from [here](https://pastebin.com/xGywzDQX) the `picom`'s Full Customised Configuration File**

##### Parameters

In the `picom.conf` file, there are specific sections to set or modify various display's aspects such as the _app's corners, shadows, blur, fading..._

Note that all the following parameters modify the above features related to _[[BSPWM|bspwm]]'s Windows_, _[[KITTY|kitty]]'s terminals_, _[[POLYBAR|polybar]]'s bars_ or _[[ROFI|rofi]]'s launcher_, among others 

###### Corners

The `corner-radius` parameter modifies the roundness degree of a _system application's corners_

```bash
corner-radius = 20;
```

![[PICOM-20240928080546309.webp|450]]

###### Shadows

To enable or disable _application's shadows_ â†’ `shadow`

```bash
shadow = true # Or false to disable them
```

Features related to shadows such as the _radius, opacity and the x/y offset_ can be modified as follows â†’

```bash
shadow-radius = 15
shadow-opacity = .5
shadow-offset-x = -15
shadow-offset-y = -15
```

###### Fading

It implements a fade effect when opening or closing _OS Windows_

In this [[SETUP|Setup Configuration]], It is disabled

```bash
fading = false # Or true to enable it
```

- **_Fading_** â†’

![[picom_fad1ing.gif|400]]

- **_No Fading_** â†’

![[picom_no_fad1ing.gif|400]]

###### Opacity

This feature controls the _Opacity_ of _Inactive/Active OS Windows_ and their _titlebars, borders..._

```bash
active-opacity = 1.0 # Active OS Window
inactive-opacity = 1.0 # Inactive OS Window
frame-opacity = 1.0 # OS Window's Titlebars and Borders
opacity = 1.0 # dmenus and pmenus
```

###### Blur

It modifies the Sharpness degree of the _Windows OS's applications_

```bash
blur-background = true # Or false to disable it
```

##### Miscellaneous

###### OS Windows Borders

Adjust the _OS Windows's **border width**_ is possible but not from the _picom's [[PICOM#Configuration File|configuration file]]_

It has to be managed from the [[BSPWM#*bspwmrc*|bspwmrc]] file through the `border_width` parameter as follows â†’

```bash
bspc config border_width 0
```

The above command removes the _OS Windows's borders_ completely

This is the chosen configuration for the _OS Windows borders_
