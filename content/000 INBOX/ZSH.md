###### PRIMARY CATEGORY â†’ [[SETUP]]

**_ZSH_ â†’ Z Shell**

This **[[SHELL SCRIPTING|shell]]** is prefered over _[[BASH|bash]]_ or _fish_ because of all the handy functionalities and customisation It offers to the users

It implements features such as â†’

- **Advanced Autocomplete**
- **Autosuggestions**
- **Syntactical Corrections**
- **Advanced [[Globbing]]**
- **Shared History between different terminals**
- **Syntax Highlighting**

#### Plugins

Most of the above features can be implemented or enhanced through _ZSH Plugins_ that are sourced from the `.zshrc` [[ZSH#Configuration File|configuration file]]
