###### PRIMARY CATEGORY â†’ [[SETUP]]

**_ZSH_ â†’ Z Shell**

This **[[SHELL SCRIPTING|shell]]** is prefered over _[[BASH|bash]]_ or _fish_ because of all the handy functionalities and customisation It offers to the users

It implements **handy features** such as â†’

**Advanced Autocomplete ~ Autosuggestions ~ Syntactical Corrections ~ Advanced [[Globbing]]**

**Shared History between different terminals ~ Syntax Highlighting**

**Main File â†’ `~/.zshrc`**

**More info [here](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh) and in the _[ZSH Manual](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/)_**

#### Plugins

Most of the above features can be implemented or enhanced through _ZSH Plugins_ that are sourced from the `.zshrc` [[ZSH#Configuration File|configuration file]]
