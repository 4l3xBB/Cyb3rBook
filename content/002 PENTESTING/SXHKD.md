###### PRIMARY CATEGORY â†’ [[SETUP]]

**[sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd) â†’ Simple X Hotkey Daemon**

`sxhkd` process is listen and reacts to input events and execute commands according to them

Most of that commands are `bspc` invocations. That `bspc` commands write in `bspwm`'s socket

```bash
$ pgrep --list-full --exact sxhkd
1643 /usr/local/bin/sxhkd
```

`sxhkd` is launched by [[BSPWM|bspwm]] from [[BSPWM#*bspwmrc*|bspwmrc]] script â†’

```bash
# ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc - sxhkd Binary Launch
checkProcess sxhkd || launchProcess sxhkd
```

> [!INFO]-
>
> Note that `checkProcess` and `launchProcess` are [[SHELL SCRIPTING|shell functions]] declared in the `~/.config/bspwm/src/bspwmrc.sh` [[BSPWM#*src/bspwmrc.sh*|source file]]
>
> Above implementation would be something similar to the usual approach through `pgrep --exact process_name || binary|script_path &` 
>
> ```bash
> #!/usr/bin/env sh
> $ pgrep --exact sxhkd > /dev/null 2>&1 || sxhkd &
> ```

All input events such as hotkeys are defined within its configuration file.

It declares all hotkeys related to launch and deploy processes and its functionalities such as:

- [[BSPWM|bspwm]] â†’ Windows Generation, Configuration Daemon Reload, Shortcuts...
<br>
- [[KITTY|kitty]] â†’ Launchs Terminal Emulator
<br>
- [[ROFI|roffi]] â†’ Deploys Program Launcher
<br>
- Other processes such as _Firefox, Burpsuite..._

**Configuration File â†’ `~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc`**

**More information [here](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd)**

#### Installation

> [!CAUTION]-
>
> First, see the [[BSPWM|bspwm's installation]] before proceeding with this one related to `sxhkd`
>
> There are some dependencies that are needed in the following installation steps
>

Clone the [sxhkd's Github Repository](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd) â†’

```bash
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ git clone https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd.git sxhkd
```

```bash
$ cd !$ # cd ~/Downloads/sxhkd
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

`~/.config/sxhkd` directory and `sxhkdrc` file â†’

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/sxhkd
$ cp ~/Downloads/bspwm/examples/sxhkdrc !$
```

> [!IMPORTANT]-
>
> Be aware that `sxhkdrc`'s _example/template_ file is copied from the `bspwm` repository rather than from the `sxhkd` one

That's it

```bash
$ command -V sxhkd
sxhkd is /usr/local/bin/sxhkd
```
